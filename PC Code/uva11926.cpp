 * Input: 
 *       First line: n m (n: the number of one-time task)
 *                       (m: the number of repeating task)
 *       Following n lines:
 *                         each line: two num, start and end time
 *       Following m lines: start, end, and interval
 * All numbers are integers in the range [0..1000000]
 * For each task, the end time is guranteed to be larger than the 
 * start time, and repetition interval is larger than 0.
 * Input terminates with: 0 0
